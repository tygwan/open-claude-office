# Post-Tool Change Tracker Hook

## Purpose
Tracks changes made and suggests relevant follow-up actions.

## Trigger Conditions
Activates after:
- `Write` tool (file created/overwritten)
- `Edit` tool (file modified)
- `Bash` tool (command executed)

## Tracking Logic

### File Changes (Write/Edit)

```bash
# Track file type and suggest actions
FILE_EXT="${FILE_PATH##*.}"

case "$FILE_EXT" in
  ts|js|tsx|jsx)
    echo "TypeScript/JavaScript file modified"
    echo "Suggestions:"
    echo "  - Run: npm run lint"
    echo "  - Run: npm test"
    ;;

```

### Command Execution (Bash)

  echo "Commit created: ${COMMIT_MSG:0:50}..."
  echo "Suggestions:"
  echo "  - Review: git show"
  echo "  - Push: git push"

  # Suggest doc update for feature commits
  if [[ "$COMMIT_MSG" == *"feat"* ]]; then
    echo "  - Update docs for new feature"
  fi
fi

# Track build operations
if [[ "$COMMAND" == *"build"* ]] || [[ "$COMMAND" == *"compile"* ]]; then
  if [[ "$EXIT_CODE" == "0" ]]; then
    echo "Build successful"
    echo "Suggestions:"
    echo "  - Run tests"
    echo "  - Check output size"
  else
    echo "Build failed"
    echo "Suggestions:"
    echo "  - Check error messages"
    echo "  - Review recent changes"
  fi
fi

# Track test operations
if [[ "$COMMAND" == *"test"* ]]; then
  if [[ "$EXIT_CODE" == "0" ]]; then
    echo "Tests passed"
  else
    echo "Tests failed"
    echo "Suggestions:"
    echo "  - Review failing tests"
